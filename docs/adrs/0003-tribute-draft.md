# [0003] Tribute Draft

# Status

Draft

# Version

0001 â€” Draft, Initial specification

# Context

A Tribute Draft (TD) is an immutable, content-addressed aggregate built from multiple Consumption Units (CUs) for a
single owner and worldwide day. Tribute Drafts provide a user-facing, pre-tribute artifact that summarizes the
settlement amounts for the selected day and currency, while preserving provenance via linked CU hashes.

This document describes the on-chain logic and data requirements for the Tribute Draft registry implemented by the
upgradeable smart contract `TributeDraftUpgradeable`.

## Goals

- Allow end users to mint a Tribute Draft by aggregating their Consumption Units
- Enforce strict aggregation rules: same owner, same worldwide day, same settlement currency
- Ensure each CU hash is used at most once across all Tribute Drafts (double-spend prevention)
- Provide deterministic TD identity derived from inputs
- Remain upgradeable via UUPS with owner-only upgrades

# Decision

We implement smart contract using Solidity with the UUPS upgradeable proxy pattern. Any user can submit a
set of CU hashes owned by them for a specific day and currency. The contract validates aggregation invariants, performs
amount summation with carry between base and atto components, assigns a deterministic TD identifier, and records the
aggregate in storage. Each referenced CU hash is globally marked as used to prevent re-aggregation elsewhere.

Key design choices:

- Compatibility with `ERC721Enumerable` standard
- Open minting by users, with on-chain checks to ensure all referenced CUs exist and belong to the caller.
- Identity is derived as keccak256(owner, worldwideDay, cuHashes), keeping the identifier deterministic for a given
  aggregation input.
- Global uniqueness for each referenced CU hash to prevent double-use across multiple TDs.
- Upgradeability via OpenZeppelin UUPSUpgradeable with onlyOwner upgrade authorization.

# Architecture

```
User (Owner) -> Proxy (UUPS) -> Implementation (TributeDraftUpgradeable)
                    |                 ^
                    v                 |
              Storage (Proxy)     Upgrades (Owner)
```

Dependencies:

- IConsumptionUnit (to fetch CU records by hash)
- OwnableUpgradeable (admin/upgrade control)
- UUPSUpgradeable (upgrade mechanism)
- ERC165Upgradeable (introspection)

# Core Data Structures

Contract: src/tribute_draft/TributeDraftUpgradeable.sol
Interface: src/interfaces/ITributeDraft.sol

TributeDraftEntity:

```solidity
struct TributeDraftEntity {
    /// @notice Owner of the tribute draft
    address owner;
    /// @notice Numeric currency code using ISO 4217
    uint16 settlementCurrency;
    /// @notice Worldwide day in a compact format YYYYMMDD (e.g., 20250923)
    uint32 worldwideDay;
    /// @notice Aggregated amount expressed in natural units (base currency units).
    uint64 settlementAmountBase;
    /// @notice Aggregated amount expressed in fractional units (atto, 1e-18). Must satisfy 0 <= amount < 1e18.
    uint128 settlementAmountAtto;
    /// @notice Hashes identifying linked consumption units
    uint256[] cuHashes;
    /// @notice Timestamp when the tribute draft was submitted
    uint256 submittedAt;
}
```

# API

All functions are available on the proxy.

- initialize(address consumptionUnit, address owner)
    - One-time initializer. Sets the ConsumptionUnit contract address and initializes OZ components.
    - Requirements: consumptionUnit != address(0)

- submit(uint256[] calldata consumptionUnitIds) -> uint256 tokenId
    - Anyone can call. Mints a Tribute Draft from the provided CU hashes.
    - Validations:
        - consumptionUnitIds are valid hash-based IDs and contains no duplicates
        - Each consumptionUnitId was not used previously in any Tribute Draft
        - For each consumptionUnitId: CU exists in ConsumptionUnit
        - All CUs share the same owner, currency, and worldwide day
    - Effects:
        - Aggregates amounts: base + atto with carry (attoSum >= 1e18 increases base)
        - Computes tdId = keccak256(abi.encode(owner, worldwideDay, consumptionUnitIds))
        - Persists TributeDraftEntity under tdId
        - Marks each consumptionUnitId as used
        - Increments total counter
    - Emits: Minted(owner, tdId)

- exists(bytes32 tokenId) -> bool
    - Returns whether a CU exists.

- getData(uint256 tokenId) -> ConsumptionUnitEntity
    - Returns the full CU structure.

- balanceOf(address owner) -> uint256
    - Returns a number of tokens owned by the given address.
-
- tokenOfOwnerByIndex(address owner, uint256 index) -> uint256
    - Returns the tokenId at the given index for the owner.

- totalSupply() -> uint256
    - Returns total number of stored tokens (monotonic increment on submission).

- owner() -> address
    - Returns contract owner.

- supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) -> bool
    - ERC165Compatible; currently delegates to super and can be extended.

# Events and Errors

Events (from ITributeDraft):

- Minted(address indexed minter, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId)

Errors (from ITributeDraft):

- EmptyArray();
- NotFound(uint256 consumptionUnitIds);
- NotSameOwner(uint256 consumptionUnitIds);
- NotSettlementCurrencyCurrency();
- NotSameWorldwideDay();

# Aggregation, Identity, and Hashing

- Identity: tdId is computed as keccak256(abi.encode(owner, worldwideDay, cuHashes)).
- The contract treats cuHashes as opaque identifiers; it verifies existence via IConsumptionUnit.getConsumptionUnit.
- Each cuHash is placed into a global set consumptionUnitHashes to ensure it is used at most once across all TDs.
- Amounts are aggregated via base+atto with carry such that atto stays in [0, 1e18).

# Access Control

- submit is permissionless for the owner of the referenced CUs; checks ensure the caller is the same as CU owner.
- Admin/upgrade operations are restricted to the contract owner (OwnableUpgradeable), including
  setConsumptionUnitAddress and upgrades.

# Upgradeability

- Pattern: UUPSUpgradeable
- Authorization: _authorizeUpgrade restricted to onlyOwner
- Initializer: initialize replaces constructor; implementation constructor disables further initializers

# Storage and Gas Considerations

- Used CU set: consumptionUnitHashes enforces one-time CU usage; O(n) marking per submit.
- TD index: mapping(uint256 => TributeDraftEntity) stores complete entries for direct retrieval by id.
- Aggregation uses a single pass across inputs; a nested pass checks for duplicates within the provided array.
- No batch function is required since submit accepts an arbitrary number of CUs in one call.

# Validation Rules Summary

On submit:

- consumptionUnitIds.length > 0 (EmptyArray)
- Input contains no duplicate consumptionUnitIds (AlreadyExists)
- Each consumptionUnitId has not been used previously in any TD (AlreadyExists)
- First CU must exist (NotFound) and caller must equal first.owner (NotSameOwner)
- For every subsequent CU:
    - CU exists (NotFound)
    - CU.owner == first.owner (NotSameOwner)
    - CU.settlementCurrency == first.settlementCurrency (NotSettlementCurrencyCurrency)
    - CU.worldwideDay == first.worldwideDay (NotSameWorldwideDay)

# Integration Notes

- Consumption Unit linkage: The contract relies on an external ConsumptionUnit registry. Ensure the address is set
  correctly during deployment and can be updated by the owner if needed.
- Indexing: Indexers can watch Submitted to maintain lists of TDs per owner and reconstruct aggregation inputs from
  cuHashes.

# Security Considerations

- Only the CU owner can aggregate into a TD; this is enforced by ownership checks against the first CU, then validated
  across all referenced CUs.
- Global uniqueness of CU hashes prevents double-counting and reuse across TDs.
- Upgrade authority is centralized; consider assigning a timelock/multisig as owner.
- No external calls are made beyond reading from the Consumption Unit contract, minimizing reentrancy risk.
