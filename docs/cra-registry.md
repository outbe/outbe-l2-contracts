# CRA Registry Contract

## Overview

The `CRARegistry` contract is a registry for managing Consumption Reflection Agents (CRAs). It provides centralized management of CRA registration, status updates, and access control for the consumption record system.

## Contract Details

- **Version**: 0.0.1
- **License**: MIT
- **Solidity Version**: ^0.8.13
- **Location**: `src/cra_registry/CRARegistry.sol`

## Architecture

The contract implements the `ICRARegistry` interface and maintains:

- A registry of CRA addresses with their information
- Status management for CRAs (Active, Inactive, Suspended)
- Owner-controlled access for administrative functions

## Core Data Structures

### CRAStatus Enum
```solidity
enum CRAStatus {
    Inactive,  // 0: CRA is not active
    Active,    // 1: CRA is active and can submit records
    Suspended  // 2: CRA is temporarily suspended
}
```

### CraInfo Struct
```solidity
struct CraInfo {
    string name;           // Human-readable name of the CRA
    CRAStatus status;      // Current status
    uint256 registeredAt;  // Registration timestamp
}
```

## State Variables

- `cras`: Mapping from CRA address to CraInfo
- `craList`: Array of all registered CRA addresses
- `owner`: Contract owner address

## Access Control

### Modifiers

- `onlyOwner`: Restricts access to contract owner
- `craExists`: Ensures CRA is registered before operations

## Core Functions

### registerCra()
```solidity
function registerCra(address cra, string calldata name) external onlyOwner
```

Registers a new CRA in the system.

**Requirements:**
- Only callable by owner
- CRA must not already be registered
- Name cannot be empty

**Effects:**
- Adds CRA to registry with Active status
- Adds to CRA list
- Sets registration timestamp

**Events Emitted:**
- `CRARegistered(cra, name, block.timestamp)`

### updateCraStatus()
```solidity
function updateCraStatus(address cra, CRAStatus status) external onlyOwner craExists(cra)
```

Updates the status of an existing CRA.

**Requirements:**
- Only callable by owner
- CRA must be registered

**Events Emitted:**
- `CRAStatusUpdated(cra, oldStatus, newStatus, block.timestamp)`

### Query Functions

#### isCraActive()
```solidity
function isCraActive(address cra) external view returns (bool)
```
Returns true if CRA is registered and has Active status.

#### getCraInfo()
```solidity
function getCraInfo(address cra) external view craExists(cra) returns (CraInfo memory)
```
Returns complete CRA information for registered CRAs.

#### getAllCras()
```solidity
function getAllCras() external view returns (address[] memory)
```
Returns array of all registered CRA addresses.

### Administrative Functions

- `getOwner()`: Get contract owner address
- `transferOwnership(address newOwner)`: Transfer ownership to new address

## Events

```solidity
event CRARegistered(address indexed cra, string name, uint256 timestamp);
event CRAStatusUpdated(
    address indexed cra, 
    CRAStatus oldStatus, 
    CRAStatus newStatus, 
    uint256 timestamp
);
```

## Custom Errors

- `CRANotFound()`: CRA is not registered in the system
- `CRAAlreadyRegistered()`: Attempting to register an already registered CRA
- `InvalidCRAStatus()`: Invalid status value provided
- `UnauthorizedAccess()`: Caller is not authorized for the operation
- `EmptyCRAName()`: Empty name provided during registration

## CRA Lifecycle

1. **Registration**: Owner registers CRA with name â†’ Status: Active
2. **Status Management**: Owner can change status to Inactive or Suspended
3. **Reactivation**: Owner can change status back to Active
4. **No Removal**: CRAs cannot be removed once registered, only status changes

## Status Definitions

- **Inactive (0)**: CRA is not permitted to submit consumption records
- **Active (1)**: CRA can submit consumption records and perform operations  
- **Suspended (2)**: CRA is temporarily disabled but remains registered

## Security Considerations

1. **Centralized Control**: Only owner can register CRAs and manage statuses
2. **Immutable Registration**: CRAs cannot be removed once registered
3. **Status Flexibility**: Owner can quickly suspend/reactivate CRAs as needed
4. **Access Control**: All administrative functions protected by owner modifier
5. **Ownership Transfer**: Owner can transfer control to new address

## Usage Example

```solidity
// Deploy the registry
CRARegistry registry = new CRARegistry();

// Register a new CRA
registry.registerCra(craAddress, "My CRA Service");

// Check if CRA is active
bool isActive = registry.isCraActive(craAddress);

// Update CRA status
registry.updateCraStatus(craAddress, CRAStatus.Suspended);

// Get all CRAs
address[] memory allCRAs = registry.getAllCras();

// Transfer ownership
registry.transferOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
```

## Integration with Consumption Record

The CRA Registry serves as the authority for:
- Determining which addresses can submit consumption records
- Providing CRA validation for the ConsumptionRecord contract
- Centralized management of CRA permissions

The ConsumptionRecord contract queries `isCraActive()` to verify permissions before allowing record submissions.

## Testing Coverage

The contract includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Registration validation and events
- Status update functionality
- Access control enforcement
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Fuzz testing for name validation
- Multi-CRA scenarios
- Ownership transfer functionality
