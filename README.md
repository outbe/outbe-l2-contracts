# Outbe L2 Contracts

Smart contracts for the Outbe Layer 2 chain.

## Requirements

- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- Npm and TypeScript (for running examples)
- Make

## How To Build And Deploy

_To see all available commands, run `make`._

**Build contracts:**

```shell
make build
```

### Local Development

**Start local node:**

```shell
anvil
```

**Deploy to local network:** (on a second terminal)

```shell
make deploy-local
```

Now you should see the deployed contracts addresses in the terminal output.

## Overview

This repository contains the core smart contracts for the Outbe L2 ecosystem, including:

- **CRA Registry**: Registry for managing Consumption Reflection Agents (CRAs)
- **Consumption Record**: Smart contract for consumption record hashes with metadata
- **Consumption Record Amendment**: Smart contract for consumption record amendment hashes with metadata
- **Consumption Unit**: Aggregation of consumption records into settlement units with currency and amounts

## Smart Contracts In-Depth

### CRA Registry

The CRA Registry manages Consumption Reflection Agents with the following features:

**Core Functions:**

- `registerCRA(address cra, string name)` - Register a new CRA (owner only)
- `updateCRAStatus(address cra, CRAStatus status)` - Update CRA status (owner only)
- `isCRAActive(address cra)` - Check if a CRA is active
- `getCRAInfo(address cra)` - Get detailed CRA information
- `getAllCRAs()` - Get list of all registered CRAs

**Access Control:** Owner-controlled administrative functions

For more information, see the [CRA Registry documentation](./docs/cra-registry.md).

### Consumption Record

The Consumption Record contract stores consumption record hashes with metadata. Only Active CRAs can submit records.

**Core Functions:**

- `submit(bytes32 crHash, address owner, string[] keys, string[] values)` - Submit consumption record (CRA only)
- `isExists(bytes32 crHash)` - Check if record exists
- `getConsumptionRecord(bytes32 crHash)` - Get complete record details
- `getConsumptionRecordsByOwner(address owner)` - Get all records owned by the given address

**Features:**

- Secure storage of consumption data hashes
- Flexible metadata system with key-value pairs
- Batch submission support (up to 100 records per batch) via Multicall.

For more information, see the [Consumption Record ADR](./docs/adrs/0001-consumption-record.md).

### Consumption Record Amendment

The Consumption Record Amendment contract stores consumption record amendments i.e.,
information about tx refunds etc. Only Active CRAs can submit records.

**Core Functions:**

- `submit(bytes32 crAmendmentHash, address owner, string[] keys, string[] values)` - Submit consumption record amendment (CRA only)
- `isExists(bytes32 crAmendmentHash)` - Check if amendment record exists
- `getConsumptionRecordAmendment(bytes32 crAmendmentHash)` - Get complete amendment details
- `getConsumptionRecordAmendmentsByOwner(address owner)` - Get all amendment records owned by the given address

**Features:**

- Secure storage of consumption data hashes for amendment
- Flexible metadata system with key-value pairs
- Batch submission support (up to 100 records per batch) via Multicall.

For more information, see the [Consumption Record ADR](./docs/adrs/0004-consumption-record-amendment.md).

### Consumption Unit

The Consumption Unit contract aggregates consumption records (and ammendment consumption records if any)
into consumption units. Only Active CRAs can submit records.

**Core Functions:**

- `submit(bytes32 cuHash, address owner, string settlementCurrency, ...)` - Submit consumption unit (CRA only)
- `isExists(bytes32 cuHash)` - Check if consumption unit exists
- `getConsumptionUnit(bytes32 cuHash)` - Get complete consumption unit details
- `getConsumptionUnitsByOwner(address owner)` - Get all consumption units owned by address

**Features:**

- Integration with consumption record hashes for traceability
- Worldwide day grouping for consumption
- Settlement currency and amounts (base + atto precision)
- Batch submission support (up to 100 records per batch) via Multicall.

For more information, see the [Consumption Unit ADR](./docs/adrs/0002-consumption-unit.md).

### Tribute Draft

The Tribute Draft contract enables users to mint non-fungible self-bound tokens by aggregating consumption units:

**Core Functions:**

- `submit(bytes32[] cuHashes)` - Mint tribute draft from multiple consumption units (any user)
- `getTributeDraft(bytes32 tdId)` - Get tribute draft details

**Features:**

- User-mintable tokens backed by consumption units
- Aggregation validation (same owner, currency, day)
- Unique tribute draft IDs based on CU hash combinations
- Consumption unit hash uniqueness enforcement

**Aggregation Rules:**

- All consumption units must have same owner (caller)
- All consumption units must have same settlement currency
- All consumption units must have same worldwide day
- Settlement amounts are automatically aggregated
- Each consumption unit can only be used once across all tribute drafts

For more information, see the [Tribute Draft ADR](./docs/adrs/0003-tribute-draft.md).

## Upgradeable Contracts

All contracts in this repository use the upgradeable pattern for production deployment:

- `CRARegistryUpgradeable.sol` - UUPS upgradeable CRA registry
- `ConsumptionRecordUpgradeable.sol` - UUPS upgradeable consumption records
- `ConsumptionRecordAmendmentUpgradeable.sol` - UUPS upgradeable consumption records amendments
- `ConsumptionUnitUpgradeable.sol` - UUPS upgradeable consumption units
- `TributeDraftUpgradeable.sol` - UUPS upgradeable tribute drafts

**Key Features:**

- **UUPS Pattern**: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard for gas-efficient upgrades
- **Proxy Addresses**: Contract addresses remain constant across upgrades
- **State Preservation**: All data and storage layout preserved during upgrades
- **Owner-Only Upgrades**: Only contract owners can authorize upgrades

## Interacting with Contracts

See the [TypeScript Examples](./examples/README.md) for examples of interacting with the contracts.

## Documentation

- [CREATE2 Deployment Guide](./docs/create2-deployment.md)
- [TypeScript Examples](./examples/README.md)

## Security

This codebase follows Solidity security best practices:

- **Access Control**: Owner-only administrative functions
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Custom errors for gas-efficient error reporting
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Following checks-effects-interactions pattern
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting
- **Deterministic Deployment**: Uses CREATE2 with salt for deterministic contract addresses
- **Explicit Ownership**: Constructors accept explicit owner parameters to avoid CREATE2 ownership issues
- **Upgradeable Architecture**: UUPS proxy pattern for seamless contract updates while preserving state and addresses
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and upgrade tests ensuring contract reliability
